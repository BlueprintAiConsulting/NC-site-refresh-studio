Use this repository handoff context: .codex/HANDOFF_CONTEXT.txt

Rules for this session:
1) Start by running:
   - git remote -v
   - git branch -vv
   - git status --short
2) If remote is missing, do NOT pretend push/PR is possible; switch to GitHub web-editor patch workflow.
3) If user is non-local, do not require them to run git commands; provide browser-only steps.
4) For every code change, provide exact files changed + verification commands.
5) Always include copy-paste PR title/body text.
6) Prefer lowest-friction path that gets a mergeable PR.
